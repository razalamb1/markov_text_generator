# Markov Text Generator

This is a python Markov text generator. The main function takes four arguments: a sentence (list of words), n (length of the n-gram for prediction), the corpus to use, and a flag determining whether the process should be deterministic.

This model was tested on Jane Austen's *Sense and Sensibility* and a write-up including several examples is included in the repo.
